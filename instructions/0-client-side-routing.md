# Client-side routing

The app we created previously in [react-101](https://github.com/react-bootcamp/react-101) is very basic: all the functionalities are available in the same page. This is technically convenient and that is a good way to start learning React, but this is not the best for the end user, mainly bescause this kind of design is not mobile friendly.

In this workshop, we will split our app into three different pages :
* one page with the list of wine regions,
* one page with the list of the wines of the region selected on the regions page,
* one page with the details of the wine selected on the wine list page.

| Regions Page | Wine list page | Wine details page |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |

Because we are in a frontend context (we are not here to learn the best backend MVC patterns :wink:), we will create a **Single Page Application** (SPA) with **client-side routing**.

A Single Page Application is a web application with a unique web page (usually this is the `index.html`). With a SPA, you do not need to load a new page from the server each time an action is done by the user, so that the user experience is better.

So we need a way to manage the navigation through the different pages of our app: we need a *client-side router*!

## Custom client-side Router with React

A simple way to write a custom client-side router with React is to define a technical component to manage the navigation.
This is a top-level component that uses its `state` to manage the current page and the navigation calls stack. It also provide an API that will be used by the different pages of the app (the `navigateTo` function).

We can define this component like that:

```javascript
// Navigator is the custom client-side router
const Navigator = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    initialRoute: React.PropTypes.shape({
      component: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired,
      title: React.PropTypes.string,
      props: React.PropTypes.object,
    }).isRequired,
  },
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      component: null, // The component to render
      title: null, // The title of the page
      props: null, // The component props
    };
  },
  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({
      component: this.props.initialRoute.component,
      title: this.props.initialRoute.title,
      props: this.props.initialRoute.props,
    });
  },
  navigateTo({ component, title, props }) {
    this.setState({ component, title, props });
  },
  render() {
    const Component = this.state.component;
    const { title, props } = this.state;
    return (
      <Component
        {...props}
        navTitle={title}
        navigator={{ navigateTo: this.navigateTo }} />
    );
  }
});

// An example page...
const Page2 = React.createClass({
  ...
});

// Another example page...
const Page1 = React.createClass({
  gotoNext() {
    // Use the router to navigate to Page2
    this.props.navigator.navigateTo({
      title: 'Page 2',
      component: Page2,
      props: {
        foo: 'bar',
      },
    });
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{this.props.navTitle}</h2>
        <button onClick={this.gotoNext}>Next</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

// Render the router into the DOM
ReactDOM.render(
  <Navigator initialRoute= {{ title: 'Page 1', component: Page1 }} />,
  document.getElementById('main')
);
```

But this simple approach has some weaknesses: the current navigation state is lost when the page is reloaded and the URL does not change in the browser when the current page changes (we could have used the `pushState` method of the HTML5 history API to do that, but we are lazy guys :simple_smile:).
To avoid such problems, there are better solutions, such as [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) that we will use to manage our Single Page Application.

## What's next

Now you're ready to write the SPA version of the Wine application.
